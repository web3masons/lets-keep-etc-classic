# Response to ETC Coop Withdrawing Support for ECIP-1098

2021.10.15

On September 20th 2021, a couple of weeks after *Let's Keep Ethereum Classic Classic* was published, Bob Summerwill, Executive Director of ETC Cooporative, informed the ETC community that The Coop have withdrawn their support for the existing ECIP-1098 Treasury proposal.

The announcement was [accompanied by a blog post](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2021-09-20-withdraws-support-for-ecip-1098) on the ETC Coop website, which we encourage interested readers to check out. We also recommend reviewing [the video debate between Bob Summerwill and Donald McIntyre](https://youtu.be/pzA4S9gZjvk) that discusses The Coop's withdrawal and provides some additional context to their decision.

Subsequently, [IOHK also announced](https://discord.com/channels/223674353001168906/223674353001168906/898565688707411978) their withdrawal of support for ECIP-1098.

## Due Credit

First and foremost we are grateful to Bob, ETC Coop and IOHK for updating the community with their decision, which enables the Treasury conversation to be moved along to its next stage, wherever that may be. The Coop's recommitment to transparency is also appreciated, and we look forward to it's continued maintenance and the engagement it facilitates.

In our view, this potentially difficult but necessary announcement demonstrates that ETC Coop is both tuned-in to community sentiment and has the humility and flexibility to correct course when required. For many ETC participants including ourselves, the decision has raised confidence in ETC Coop's current leadership, which continues to prove itself a positive force for Ethereum Classic.

## Ding, Dong, ECIP-1098 is Dead

It is our sense that without the support of ETC Coop or IOHK, major stewards and players in the ETC decision-making process, ECIP-1098 in its current form is extremely unlikely to be implemented; it is in Bob's words "[totally dead](https://youtu.be/pzA4S9gZjvk?t=3351)".

From our perspective this is certainly a positive development, but we will restrain from premature celebration as the withdrawal announcement is not necessarily the final nail in the Treasury's coffin.

## The Battle Continues, Maybe

According to the withdrawal announcement, ETC Coop believe that it is still necessary to implement a protocol-layer Treasury system on ETC, but wish to do so in a way that "can avoid the shortcomings of ECIP-1098". Whilst [for reasons we have explained previously](/) we are doubtful that a *protocol-layer* treasury system that is sufficiently decentralized could be conceived of, we won't jump to any conclusions about the viability of potential future proposals and must remain open to the possibility that this circle can be squared.

It is essential that the ETC decision-making process remains open to good proposals regardless of where they come from; transparently engaging with and judging ideas based on their merit alone. If a new proposal (Treasury or otherwise) is introduced by ECIP-1098's proponents, we hope that all participants engage and evaluate impartially, without being influenced by a love or hate for ECIP-1098.

With that being said, and with some additional context to engage with, we will respond to some points made in the withdrawal announcement and the video debate in order to help tee up discussion for the next phase of ETC's funding saga.

## Sweeping Problems (under the rug)

According to the withdrawal announcement, the primary reason for ECIP-1098 being rejected was a lack of consensus on how to solve the [ETC, not USD](/#etc-not-usd) problem, which was presumably being discussed in private by some Treasury proponents before the publication of *Let's Keep Ethereum Classic Classic*.

To remedy this problem, ETC Coop proposed a "sweeping mechanism" to cap the profits of Treasury Beneficiaries in the case that changes in ETC price and budget requirements caused over-funding. Allegedly this compromise was not acceptable to IOHK, which led to the withdrawal.

Whilst understandably outside the scope of the withdrawal announcement, we wish to make the point that fixing the over-funding problem alone would only address one of the Treasury's more egregious issues and still leaves many others on the table. If a new Treasury proposal is put forward, hopefully attempts will be made to tackle some of the other concerns we have highlighted previously.

We agree that a "sweeping mechanism" or similar system to cap private profits would *help* with this particular problem, but this solution still seems ripe for abuse, and introduces other issues to sort out. Without diving too deep, some obvious questions come to mind:

- How do participants come to consensus about how much budget is appropriate for each team?
- What mechanism forces teams to give back unused funds, other than good will?
- Assuming excess funds are "swept", where do they go?
- If excess funds go a community pot, does it suffer similar problems?

Sweeping is also less than ideal as the full upfront cost of network security via reduced miner rewards is still incurred, and while the dev tax could theoretically be returned to other miners post-sweep, this creates a distortion in the rewards schedule that introduces periods of relative vulnerability.

## The Bitcoin Standard

To presumably to counter the idea that Ethereum Classic should follow Bitcoin's treasuryless development funding model, the withdrawal announcement contrasts both projects:

> Unlike Bitcoin, which could likely be run pretty much “as is” in perpetuity, the Ethereum and ETC protocol and codebases need ongoing maintenance and protocol tweaking because of the added complexity of being a general computing platform. The crypto-economics are complicated and there is much more opportunity for attack vectors.

This point was also discussed in the [video debate](https://youtu.be/pzA4S9gZjvk?t=4675), where Bob further argues that ETC is not currently at the same stage as BTC, which being more popular and mature, has whales and companies building on top of it who are able to donate or otherwise contribute to client development.

We can at least agree that ETC and BTC are different beasts, and that ETC is likely to require more work in terms of basic upkeep due to its increased complexity and attack surface, as evidenced by recent vulnerability-fixing hard forks.

However, the idea that ETC can't follow BTC's funding model because it has additional maintenance requirements does not follow. It's clear that even without a Treasury Bitcoin has attracted far more developer resources that would be required to meet ETC's basic needs - that those requirements are different is moot. Indeed, Bitcoin's treasuryless development model goes far beyond the basics and has delivered research and development culminating in the release of upgrades such as segwit and taproot, which are no small feat.

One of the larger differences at play between the two projects is that of maturity, with BTC being 12 years old and ETC existing for only 6. Fair enough that they do not have the same level of interest today, but BTC did not have a treasury 6 years ago either, and still managed to not just do basic upkeep but also garner contributions beyond the level that would be required for basic upkeep of ETC.

From our perspective, highlighting the difference in maintenance difficulty between the two projects is a bit of a red herring, as the problem of meeting basic upkeep funding is primarily controlled by other factors, namely market cap.

Indeed, in the video debate Bob later seems to agree with this, and speculates that at some point in the future, just like BTC, ETC will hopefully reach the stage where it is big enough for whales/companies to be incentivized to donate resources; there'll so much cash floating around that financing basic upkeep is a non-issue.

This "Goldilocks Zone" of self-perpetuation is definitely where ETC wants to be, but [as we have argued](/#blockchain-seppuku), we believe that relies not *not* having a Treasury. Despite ETC's additional development burden, it is our belief that far from justifying the need for a protocol layer treasury, the correct takeaway from a comparison with Bitcoin is to try to emulate BTC's wild success more closely, rather than further distancing ETC from this proven philosophical and development formula.

## Reaching the Goldilocks Zone

But hold on. Isn't ETC already in the Goldilocks Zone; this ideal of having whales and companies fund development sounds awfully similar to the current situation, no?

While ETC is certainly in a less comfortable position than BTC in this regard, ETC Coop, at least, have a good amount of runway. Commendably, they publish their finances publicly, and their [most recent report](https://etccooperative.org/ETC-Coop-Board-Package-July-August-2021.pdf) shows they have about $3,200,000 in cash from (whale and company) Grayscale. This is the war chest of just one steward, and other players like ETC Labs have their own private reserves.

On top of this, it seems likely that as time goes on the cryptocurrency space including ETC will continue to expand, which will translate into larger market cap and more spare resources that can be dedicated to development, essential or otherwise.

Whether or not ETC is already in this Goldilocks Zone, recent price rises show that it is certainly travelling in the right direction, and reaching self-sustainability is in all likelihood just a matter 'holding out'. Drastic steps like the  implementation of a protocol layer Treasury run the real risk of knocking us off course.

## Innovation vs Implementation

One major point of confusion surrounding the Treasury that [we tried to untangle previously](/#client-development-essential) was uncertainty about what it was supposed to be funding. The framing from some that the Treasury was meant to facilitate "innovation" seemed to create a disconnect as to whether or not it was really needed at all; was it essential, or nice to have?  

Thankfully, [Bob settled this confusion](https://youtu.be/pzA4S9gZjvk?t=1898), and we agree that the real issue to be solved is not innovation per se, but implementation - in other words, if there are limited resources, it makes sense to spend them on things that are of critical importance, including keeping up the with EVM standard, fixing vulnerabilities, optimization, and client stability. For us, clarification on this point realigns expectations for the better.

It's not our place to tell private organizations how spend their own budgets, but with the Treasury off the table, now seems like a good time to brainstorm potential strategies for ensuring there is enough fuel in the tank to reach self-sustainability *a la* Bitcoin. If the goal is to maximize the probability of reaching this point, resources should be utilized efficiently so that basic client upkeep is maintained for as long as possible.

To that end, we will propose some open questions that might drive some discussion 

- How has the recent increase in reserves affected the roadmap/runway for client maintenance?
- One client, less complexity, less plates to spin?
- This requires a more focused development path...
- Less innovation
- True, but this is actually solved by doing *less* innovation the core protocol and getting solid foundation over time
- Is multiple clients actually a good idea?
- Would it not be simpler to have one reliable, little-changing reference client (geth), rather than 3 clients with constingly catching up with an ever-changing implementaiton?
- We beleive we should focus on reaching a point where we CAN keep running things "as is" or as close to that as possible

## Time to Refocus

- Is it possible to quantify what the real world costs of minimal necessary development of one client, and if so, 

This is just my opinion, a potential strategy to be mulled, not trying to direct anyone...

- Bob seems to argue that the focus of a treasury should be on implementation rather than innovation, we agree, but there is some uncertainty about what that involves and how far away we are from that, is it so far that only  a treasury can fix it?
- dont sink more time and energy into another treasury prposal for now, it has too many problems
- instead, make it clear to the community how bad the problem actually is and what is required to meet minimum developometn needs
- get rid of the confusing and illogical messaging around innovation and implementation; what is the actual mission now?
- Don't tamper with it until it's absolutely necessary
- Create a fund that is specifically for maintenance, one client, bare minimum
- If it is this basic level of maintenance that is sought after, price it up and solicit funding publically, not just from DFG, know that many people will happily donate if it means this otherwise essential development doesn't get done, pay yourselves a salary to manage it, fine, but and perhaps this transparency will be a path towards future funding
- This basic and essential level of development requirements contrasts with the main argument for a  treasury, which intends for the funds to be used for "innovation" to compete
- This ambiguity of intent is likely responsible for a lot of uncertainty around devleopment requiements and is not necessary
- How much does it cost to meet the basic development requirements? If we know this, then we can look towards funding models that can probably meet those requriements
- use reserves WISELY for maintanance only
- DeFudding
- Idea: donations system for signalling
- What does ETC Coop see it's role as?
- patreon on ETC
- status on a new treasury proposal?
- this conversation is a very healthy sign, it means ETC solves this then it proves itself to be self sustaining and much more powerful

Anyway, with disagreements out of the way, it is clear that the overall goal of achieving success for ETC is not in doubt, and are glad that at least one essential part of ETC, it's open and decentralized decision-making process, is working as intended.
