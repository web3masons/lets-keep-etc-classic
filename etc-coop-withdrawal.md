# Response to ETC Coop Withdrawing Support for ECIP-1098

2021.10.15

On September 20th 2021, a couple of weeks after this document was originally published, Bob Summerwill, Executive Director of ETC Cooporative, informed the ETC community via Discord that ETC Cooperative have withdrawn support for the existing ECIP-1098 Treasury proposal.

The announcement was  [accompanied with a blog post](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2021-09-20-withdraws-support-for-ecip-1098) on the ETC Coop website, which we encourage interested readers to check out. We also recommend reviewing [the video 'debate' between Bob Summerwill and Donald McIntyre](https://youtu.be/pzA4S9gZjvk) that discusses The Coop's withdrawal and provides some additional context to their decision.

Subsequently, [IOHK also announced](https://discord.com/channels/223674353001168906/223674353001168906/898565688707411978) their withdrawal of support for ECIP-1098.

## Due Credit

First and foremost we are grateful to Bob, ETC Coop and IOHK for updating the community with their decision, which enables the Treasury conversation to be moved along to it's next stage, wherever that may be. The Coop's recommitment to transparency is also appreciated and we look forward to it's continued maintenance.

In our view, this potentially difficult but necessary action demonstrates that ETC Coop is both tuned-in to community sentiment and has the humility and flexibility to correct course when required. As such, for many ETC participants, the decision has raised confidence in ETC Coop's current leadership, which continues to prove itself a positive force for Ethereum Classic.

## Ding, Dong, ECIP-1098 is Dead

It is our sense that without the support of ETC Coop or IOHK, major stewards and players in the ETC decision making process, ECIP-1098 in it's current form is extremely unlikely to be implemented; it is in Bob's words "[totally dead](https://youtu.be/pzA4S9gZjvk?t=3351)".

From our perspective this is certainly a positive development but we will restrain from premature celebration as the withdrawal announcement is not necessarily the final nail in the Treasury's coffin.

## The Battle Continues, Maybe

According to the withdrawal announcement, ETC Coop believe that it is still necessary to implement a protocol-layer Treasury system on ETC, but wish to do so in a way that "can avoid the shortcomings of ECIP-1098". Whilst [for reasons we have explained previously](/) we are doubtful that a *protocol-layer* treasury system that is sufficiently decentralized could be conceived of, we won't jump to any conclusions about the viability of potential future proposals and must remain open to the possibility that this circle can be squared.

It is essential that the ETC decision making process remains open to good proposals regardless of where they come from; transparently engaging with and judging ideas based on their merit alone. If a new proposal (Treasury or otherwise) is introduced by ECIP-1098's proponents, we hope that all participants engage and evaluate impartially, without being influenced by a love or hate for ECIP-1098.

With that being said, and with some additional context to engage with, we will respond to some of the points made in the withdrawal announcement and the video 'debate' in order to help tee up discussion for the next phase of ETC's funding saga.

## Sweeping Problems (under the rug)

According to the withdrawal announcement, the primary reason for ECIP-1098 being rejected was a lack of consensus on how to solve the [ETC, not USD](/#etc-not-usd) problem, which was presumably being discussed in private by some Treasury proponents before the publication of *Let's Keep Ethereum Classic Classic*. Credit to The Coop for recognizing this as the showstopper that it is.

Whilst understandably outside the scope of the withdrawal announcement, we wish to make the point that that fixing this problem alone would only be addressing one of the Treasury's (more egregious) issues and still leaves many others on the table. If a new Treasury is proposed, hopefully attempts are made to address some of the other concerns we have highlighted previously.

We agree that a "sweeping mechanism" or similar system to cap private profits would *help* to remedy this particular issue with the Treasury proposal, but the solution proposed is itself far from perfect and introduces additional (albeit smaller) problems.

- how to enforce?
- it's totally vuluntary and incentivises budget expansion / deception
- otherwise an oracle of some sort would be needed, but this makes things more difficult
- even with perfect enforcement, how to give the money back?
- cannot bring back lost network security
- if it goes into a community pot for future funding it could still be wasted

## The Bitcoin Standard

To presumably to counter the idea that Ethereum Classic should follow Bitcoin's Treasuryless development funding model, the withdrawal announcement contrasts both projects:

> Unlike Bitcoin, which could likely be run pretty much “as is” in perpetuity, the Ethereum and ETC protocol and codebases need ongoing maintenance and protocol tweaking because of the added complexity of being a general computing platform. The crypto-economics are complicated and there is much more opportunity for attack vectors.

This was also follow up with additional discussion in the video debate, where Bob elaborates on this point. We agree that ETC and BTC are different beasts, and that ETC probably requires more work to maintain due to it's increased complexity and attack surface.

- We agree that ETC is more complicated, more attack surface and more susceptible to economic attacks, and if the goal is to just to operate the chain "as is" with no updates, because of this it would require more effort to do so with ETC
- Probably referring to recent attack vectors utilized against ETC (london fixed?)
- But Bitcoin is being updated, not being run 'as is' and still manages to receive development
- This is not an argument for a treasury, but a more focused development path, as we argue above
- One client
- BTC is still getting updates, such as taproot, segwit, etc, how is this possible?
- We can only assume this is because of the sick gains made by bitcoin, and there is far more funding going on behind the scenes on bitcoin that is not coming from a treasury or central foundation, and with recent price action in ETC this should also begin to trickle down.
- Why should we expect any different from the bitcoin path? 
- BTC is 12 years old, ETC is only 6 years old
- BTC in 2016 wasn't that impressive, but it became so

## Innovation vs Implementation

- Less innovation
- True, but this is actually solved by doing *less* innovation the core protocol and getting solid foundation over time
- Is multiple clients actually a good idea?
- Would it not be simpler to have one reliable, little-changing reference client (geth), rather than 3 clients with constingly catching up with an ever-changing implementaiton?

## Refocusing

- dont sink more time and energy into another treasury prposal for now, it has too many problems
- instead, make it clear to the community how bad the problem actually is and what is required to meet minimum developometn needs
- get rid of the confusing and illogical messaging around innovation and implementation; what is the actual mission now?
- Don't tamper with it until it's absolutely necessary
- We dont need a treasury, we don't need a money grab, we need a refocus, and it's partly the responsibility of it's custodians (ETC Coop) to make these decisions, as they have already received funding
- Create a fund that is specifically for maintenance, one client, bare minimum
- If it is this basic level of maintanance that is sought after, price it up and solicit funding publically, not just from DFG, know that many people will happily donate if it means this otherwise essential development doesn't get done, pay yourselves a salary to manage it, fine, but and perhaps this transparency will be a path towards future funding
- This basic and essential level of development requirements contrasts with the main argument for a  treasury, which intends for the funds to be used for "innovation" to compete
- This ambiguity of intent is likely responsible for a lot of uncertainty around devleopment requiements and is not necessary
- How much does it cost to meet the basic development requirements? If we know this, then we can look towards funding models that can probably meet those requriements
- Instead we are presented with much higher ambitions
- use reserves WISELY for maintanance only
- DeFudding

## Onward

- agree that maintenance is required on ETC
- identify the problem
- patreon on ETC
- a new treasury proposal
- this conversation is a very healthy sign, it means ETC solves this then it proves itself to be self sustaining and much more powerful

Anyway, with disagreements out of the way, it is clear that the overall goal of achieving success for ETC is not in doubt, and are glad that at least one essential part of ETC, it's open and decentralized decision making process, is working as intended.
